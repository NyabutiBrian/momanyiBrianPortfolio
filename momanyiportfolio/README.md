## REACT FRAMEWORK

    - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website.

### Creating a React App:

    Terminal or command prompt.
    ```bash
    npm install -g create-react-app - install npm globally
    npx create-react-app frontend
    cd frontend
    npm install react-router-dom
    npm i @vercel/analytics
    npm start
    ```
